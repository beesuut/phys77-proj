1	Fluid Dynamics		  Flow around a body, through a grate, etc
2	Nuclear Reactors		Why does U235 work? Show that certain parameters do not result in net energy gain
3	Redshift            Determining the cosmological constant through a code system that can engage with redshifts (that we've calculated)
