Monte Carlo Simulation for an idealized (homogeneous and spherical) nuclear fission reactor.

Model:

1. Neutrino travel, escape, and interactions (absorption, scattering, and fission)
2. Criticality / Power production
3. Antineutrino flux out of the reactor / Plutonium production

# Notes on readability:

Comments should be lowercase and begin with a space
    '# example comment'

Inline comments should be tabbed at least once

'#%%' used as a comment to separate sections of code within a single file
    Also allows for python file to be run in blocks (like a notebook)
