Physics 77 Capstone Project

Monde Carlo Simulation for an idealized (homogeneous and spherical) nuclear fission reactor.

Model:

1. Neutrino travel, escape, and interactions (absorption, scattering, and fission)
2. Criticality / Power production
3. Antineutrino flux out of the reactor / Plutonium production
